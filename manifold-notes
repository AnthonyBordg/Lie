Notes on the Smooth_Manifolds package and the definition of diffeomorphism.

\S 4. A chart is an open set C with a structure preserving map \phi to a subset
E of Euclidean space.

\S 5. A topological manifold M is defined as a set of charts { C_i, \phi_i }.  
The C_i are all subsets of M so the overlaps are just C_i \cap C_j .
A particular set of charts A is an atlas (defined in \S 6).
Usually one requires that \forall x \in M, \exists C_i\in A s.t. x \in C_i.
But here we just take M = \union_i C_i by definition.

There is no unique atlas on a manifold.  In math, a maximal atlas A is
one such that there exists no atlas B such that A \subset B.  The
definition in \S 6.2.1 does not seem to be this.  The maximal atlas is
said to be unique, but it probably cannot be explicitly constructed.

\S 6. A C^k differentiable manifold M is a topological manifold such that
the maps \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1} are C^k (smooth compatibility).

\S 6.3. A smooth map f : M -> N is one such that
\forall x\in M, \exists C_i \in A_M, C_j \in A_N s.t. x\in C_i, f(x)\in C_j
and \phi_j \circ f \circ \phi_i^{-1} is C^k on the intersection of the
various domains of definition.

This is not quite the definition of diff in \S 6.3 which also assumes
that f restricted to C_i is a subset of C_j.  This is not true in
general as one can see by considering the identity map between the two
atlases A_1 and A_2 for the sphere defined below.  Thus the identity
map is not smooth in the sense of diff.

Perhaps this can be fixed in a straightforward way by taking the
intersection of C_i with the preimage of C_j under f and only checking
the C^k condition there.  Another way to fix the problem is to define
the maximal refinement R(A) of an atlas to consist of all subsets of
the C_i with the restrictions of the \phi_i.  Then instead of A_1 and
A_2 we consider R(A_1) and R(A_2).  Perhaps one of these solutions are
implemented in the later definitions, but I didn't see it.

\S 6.5. Two manifolds M and N are diffeomorphic if there exist smooth maps
f:M -> N and g: N->M s.t. f\circ g=g\circ f = identity.

\S 11. Definition of a sphere S^d whose atlas A_1 has two charts,
U_+ = stereographic projection of S^d - (south pole)
U_- = stereographic projection of S^d - (north pole).

Candidate definition of a hypersurface f=0 in R^n :
for each point x\in R^n with f(x)=0, decompose the tangent space to x
(isomorphic to R^n) into orthogonal subspaces \lambda(grad f) \oplus V.
The implicit function theorem then gives us a map u_x from a ball in V
to \lambda(grad f) such that f( u_x v \oplus v )=0.
We use this to produce a chart (U_x,\phi_x) with 
\phi_x^{-1} (v) = u_x v \oplus v.

We can now define S^d as a hypersurface 1 = \sum_i=1^{d+1} x_i^2 in
R^{d+1}.  Let A_2 be the atlas obtained by the construction above.  It
has a chart for every point x, in which U_x is the projection of the
hemisphere centered on x.

To test this definition we want to prove that it is diffeomorphic to
the A_1 definition.  Suppose we work with R(A_1) and R(A_2) as above,
we need to show that there exist C_i's and C_j's as in the definitions
above.  Since the carrier sets are isomorphic, this amounts to showing
that for each x \in S^d there are C_i\in R(A_1) and C_j\in R(A_2) both
containing x.  This is manifest for A_2, while for A_1 we can take the
preimage of a small ball.  So this should be doable.


Subsequent goals:

Define group action on a manifold (Kirillov chapter 2).

Define the exponential map (Kirillov chapter 3).
